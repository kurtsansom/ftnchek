			     FTNCHEK 4.beta
			       July, 2012

Below is a small list of features that could be added to ftnchek
relatively easily, and ought to be implemented as soon as possible.
They are more or less in order of increasing effort required.
Volunteers to work on implementing any of these items are welcomed,
and should contact moniot@fordham.edu for advice and assistance.

1. Check attribute-based declarations for violating various simple
   constraints, e.g. more than one LEN or KIND keyword in a specifier
   list.

2. OPTIONAL statements and attributes.  Use these to adjust
   checking of agreement of subprogram arguments.

3. Semantic processing of INTERFACE blocks.  This is necessary to
   support generic procedures, operator overloading, and user-defined
   operators.

4. Check formats for legality, and for agreement with their I/O lists.
