		 Ftnchek Version 3.3 Patch Level 1
			    February, 2005


Changes made in Patch 1:

   1. Fixed bug in parsing a declaration of the form
        DOUBLE PRECISION :: X

   2. Fixed an inconsistency in checking for possible precision issues
      when the -portability or -truncation option is turned on.
      Previously, such warnings were reported for arithmetic
      expressions but not for relational expressions (arithmetic
      comparisons).  Now they are reported for both, using the same
      criteria.  Thus, comparing two operands will generate the
      warnings under the same conditions as adding them.  For example,
      IF( D .gt. 0.3 ) where D is double precision, will generate a
      warning that the single-precision constant 0.3 is being
      promoted.

   3. Increased the number of error messages suppressed by -nocheck to
      cover invalid type combinations in expressions.  Normally these
      error messages should not be suppressed, but when using ftnchek
      to generate a call graph or other summary results on code
      containing unsupported syntax extensions, it may be reasonable
      to suppress them.
