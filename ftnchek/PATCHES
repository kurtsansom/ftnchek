		 Ftnchek Version 4.alpha patch 2
			    May 30, 2012

Major changes since patch 1:

  -- Array sections are supported.  Note, however, that detailed array
     shapes are not presently stored, so only rank and total size are
     checked for conformance in array-valued expressions and
     assignments.

  -- Array constructors and derived-type constructors are accepted.
     For array constructors, both the Fortran 90 delimiters (/ ... /)
     and the Fortran 2010 delimiters [ ... ] are accepted.

  -- Derived types having array and character components with subarray
     and substring expressions are accepted.

  -- Functions with RESULT clauses are treated correctly.

  -- Recursive functions and subroutines are supported.

  -- Numerous bugs fixed.



Major changes since patch 0:

  -- ONLY and rename lists in USE statements supported.

  -- PRIVATE type components in module-declared types are honored.

  -- Warns of pointer and allocatable variables possibly used before
     associated or allocated.

  -- Fixed bug in evaluation of intrinsic functions that may be used
     in type declarations.

  -- Fixed some bugs in handling of derived types and modules.
