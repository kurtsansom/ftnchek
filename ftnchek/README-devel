README for developers

OK, so you have checked out the source from sourceforge and are now
trying to figure out how to get it to build.  Because the svn
repository only contains those files that cannot be built from others,
it is not quite ready, and a few more steps are needed.

First, for reference, here is the way to check it out:

svn checkout https://ftnchek.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/ftnchek/ftnchek ftnchek


Now, do the following steps:

1. Copy config.sub, config.guess, and install.sh from your local
autoconf installation.  (You must have autoconf installed.)  E.g.
  $ cp /usr/share/automake-1.11/config.sub .
  $ cp /usr/share/automake-1.11/config.guess .
  $ cp /usr/share/automake-1.11/install-sh .

2. Now run autoconf to create configure script.
  $ autoconf

2a. On Ubuntu systems, "sh" is linked to "dash" which is not
compatible with some sh scripts.  It may be necessary (via sudo) to
change the link to point to "bash".

3. At this point configure should work.
  $ ./configure

4. Now build the executable.  First run of "make" will fail out due to
tokdefs.h being created new.  This is normal.  Re-run.
  $ make
  $ make

5. The regression test suite in directory "test" is distributed so
users can use "make check" to test that their build works correctly.
You should use it to make sure you do not introduce new bugs.  But no
test/Okay files are under revision control, so the first "make check"
will create them new.  (If there is a distribution tarball based on
the current revision, you can compare the results to the test/Okay
that is there.  Otherwise you just have to trust that they are
correct.)
  $ make check


At this point you are all set to proceed with development.
